    options: [
      "When the model falls asleep",

      "When the loss function reaches zero",
      "When the model runs out of memory"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Mode collapse happens when a generative model (typically a GAN) finds a few outputs that fool the discriminator and produces only those, ignoring the diversity of the real data.",

    options: [
      "Pre-training is on a small dataset; Fine-tuning is on a large one",

      "Fine-tuning happens before Pre-training"

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "Pre-training is the computationally expensive phase of learning general knowledge from vast corpora. Fine-tuning is the subsequent phase of specializing the model for a use case.",
